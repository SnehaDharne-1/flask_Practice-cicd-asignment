---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Activate venv

source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**`requirements.txt` example:**

bson
```

### 4. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

# Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline for Flask Application

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using **Jenkins** for a simple **Python Flask** web application.

The pipeline automatically performs the following tasks:

- Clone the source code from GitHub.
- Create a Python Virtual Environment.
- Install all required Python dependencies.
- Execute unit tests using **pytest**.
- Deploy the Flask application if all tests pass successfully.

This project was developed as part of the **Hero Vired DevOps Assignment**.

# Jenkins Pipeline

The project contains a **Declarative Jenkins Pipeline** inside the `Jenkinsfile`.

The pipeline contains four stages.

## Stage 1 – Checkout

Downloads the latest source code from GitHub.

## Stage 2 – Build

Creates a Python virtual environment and installs all required dependencies using `pip`.

## Stage 3 – Test

Runs the unit tests using **pytest**.

If any test fails, the pipeline stops.

## Stage 4 – Deploy

Starts the Flask application.

## Notes

* Make sure MongoDB is running and accessible via the URI in `.env`
* Delete action includes a confirmation page to prevent accidental deletion
* Uses `ObjectId` from `bson` to work with MongoDB document IDs
* If you use MongoDB Atlas on macOS, install dependencies again (`pip install -r requirements.txt`). This project now uses `certifi` CA bundle explicitly to avoid common TLS certificate verification failures with `pymongo`.
